The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the 
approximation sinx≈x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity
                          3
sin x = 3 sin(x/3) − 4 sin (x/3)  

To reduce the size of the argument of sin. 
(For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) 

These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))


How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?
What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

Rewriting the sine process as below. Including a step counter and a display step operation into it

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle step)
  (display step) (display ": ") (display angle) (newline)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0) (+ step 1)))))

Calling (sine 12) gives below output.
1: 12.15
2: 4.05
3: 1.3499999999999999
4: 0.44999999999999996
5: 0.15
6: 0.049999999999999996
-0.39980345741334

This answers the first question. 

Now each step's value is the value of the previous step divided by 3. This iteration will stop when 

angle
-------  < 0.1
  3^n


-->       angle
          -----     < 3^n
          0.1

Taking logarithm on both sides, we get 

-->        { angle }
      log  { ----- }   <   log(3^n)
           {  0.1  }

--> log angle - log 0.1 < 3 log n

--> log angle - log 0.1
    -------------------       < 3
         log n

Thus the number of steps here is Θ(log angle) ~ Θ(log n)
